# Helios Network Core
The complete core for Helios Practice, a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server made for PocketMine-MP 3.0.

## About

Helios Practice was a public Minecraft practice PVP server for the Bedrock Edition variant of the game. The network reached a total of more than 9400 registered players and a peak of 32 concurrently online players. Due to a lack of developer motivation, time, and interest in the Minecraft Bedrock Edition community itself, as well as the notorious reason of financing, Helios Practice closed officially on February 1st, 2021, marking the end of the server's 8-month period, being officially released on June 14th, 2020.

### Practice Core

**General:** Staff permissions/op permissions, anticheat with autoclicker and reach detections, alias system, anti-alt system, alert notifications if a player joins with alternate accounts, good-healing pots, functional scoreboards, combat logger, pearl cooldown system with smooth XP bar formatting, Discord server status webhooks, and a CPS counter mod above the hotbar.

**FFA Arena System:** Scoreboards with ping, TPS, and arena name, auto-rekit on kill, custom kill messages (blown to smithereens, sent to the moon, etc.), lightning on kill, and custom smooth knockback that varies for each arena.

**Duel System:** Ranked & unranked gamemodes (NoDebuff, Gapple, Combo, Sumo, BuildUHC), fully configurable in the config.yml, and scoreboards with player ping, map name, opponent name, and CPS.

From the owners & developers: On behalf of the Helios staff team, we'd like to give a big thanks to all of those who helped make Helios what it was back then. To see the server progress as far as it did is something that still blows our minds today. It would have never been possible without a committed staff & development team.
